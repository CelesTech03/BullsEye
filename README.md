## User Stories

The following functionality is completed:

- [x] Put a button on the screen and label it “Hit Me!
- [ ] When the player presses the Hit Me! button, the app has to show an alert pop-up to inform the player how well he or she did. Somehow, you have to calculate the score and put that into this alert.
- [x] Put text on the screen, such as the “Score:” and “Round:” labels. Some of this text changes over time; for example, the score, which increases when the player scores points.
- [x] Put a slider on the screen with a range between the values 1 and 100.
- [x] Read the value of the slider after the user presses the Hit Me! button.
- [x] Generate a random number at the start of each round and display it on the screen. This is the target value.
- [ ] Compare the value of the slider to that random number and calculate a score based on how far off the player is. You show this score in the alert pop-up.
- [ ] Put the Start Over button on the screen. Make it reset the score and put the player back to the first round.
